## What's this?  

>As you can see, this is a 'chowder'. It may contain anything that I want to record, share, or complain about. I will put something interesting I found either on the Internet, or from books, or by talking with others, or some toy-level coding web app here. But it is a web project based on Golang in nature.  

## What's the difference between this and a blog site?  

>Basically, there is no difference in nature. And the most of time, this project is for coding practice purposes so it might take quite a long time for me to beautify it. Yup, maybe there won't be any formal frontend pages until I learned how to build one.  

## How's this project organized?

>I'll try my best to follow the standard from [here](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout)
